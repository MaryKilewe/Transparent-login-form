# Transparent-login-form
simple code to make a form with a transparent background for a visually appealing webpage.
Take note of the internal css. The id form Design contains a css line that says ' background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .4); '
Normally, it would appear as background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0).
The forth character represent opacity which has been given the value 0.4 or .4
That means that the opacity (opaqueness) of the color rgb(0, 0, 0); has been lowered to 0.4
The lower the value, the more transparent the background
